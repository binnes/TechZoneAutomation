# Bill of Materials

To deploy infrastructure or software using TechZone Automation you need to start by creating a **Bill of Materials** (BOM)  or using a predefined BOM.

!!!Todo
    Link the ascent tool and the predefined BOMs

The BOM defines the modules you want to install.  Available modules can be found in the [Module Catalog](https://modules.cloudnativetoolkit.dev){target=:blank}

!!!Todo
    Why are some modules not in the catalog (e.g. [k8s-ocp-cluster](https://github.com/cloud-native-toolkit/terraform-k8s-ocp-cluster) - does this mean they are obsolete or incomplete?

## Investigations to do

-   dependencies (including default vs specified), aliases and dependency resolution (*iascable build*)
-   variables, input and output
-   how to discover what a module does

## Dependencies

When you want to install a module there maybe some dependencies that module needs to allow it to be installed.  For example, if you want to use GitOps (ArgoCD) to install an application then GitOps needs to be available and configured on the target cluster.  Similarly if I want to install and configure GitOps then I need to have a cluster to install GitOps into.

Every module in TechZone automation defines it's dependencies in a module.yaml file in the module's github repository.  Thr module's repo is linked by clicking on the module name in the [modules catalog](https://modules.cloudnativetoolkit.dev){target=:blank}

### Alias

Sometimes a module dependency can be satisfied by multiple modules.  In this case an alias can be used, where a module can register that it satisfies an alias.  An example of this is the alias cluster.  Any module that makes a Kubernetes cluster available to other modules will define the **cluster** alias.  This then provides a generic way to specify a cluster dependency.  So long as a module is included in a BOM that satisfies the cluster alias the dependency will be met.

If you explore the **cluster** category in the [modules catalog](https://modules.cloudnativetoolkit.dev){target=:blank} you will see a number of options for installing a Kubernetes cluster, including an option to simple provide the login to an existing cluster - all these modules will satisfy the **cluster** dependency.

### Optional

Some dependencies can be specified as optional.  This is where a module may be able to complete the installation without the optional dependency being satisfied in the BOM.  An example of this is that modules using GitOps to perform an installation will specify the cluster as optional.  This is because the module doesn't need to interact with the cluster to complete the installation.  The module can simple create content in a GitOps repository to complete the installation on a cluster.

### Outstanding Questions

!!!Todo
    -   In the module.yaml what are the **refs** and **interface** properties used for?
        -   What does it mean when a dependency has multiple refs (e.g. [artifactory](https://github.com/cloud-native-toolkit/terraform-tools-artifactory/blob/main/module.yaml))?
    -   How does the **platform** property work - any implications/restrictions or is this a testing statement?

    How are dependencies resolved? 
    
    -   if a single module satisfies a dependency is it automatically selected?  
    -   can a default module be specified if there are multiple modules that satisfy a dependency and one is not included in a BOM?
    -   is there a feature to allow an OR with dependencies (I need to have a MySQL or Postgres DB)?

### Verifying all dependencies are resolved

Once a BOM has been completed you can validate that all dependencies have been satisfied or can be resolved by running the **iascable** tool.  This will be covered in more detail in the [deploy](deploy.md) section.

``` shell
    iascable build -i my_bom.yaml
```

*where **my_bom.yaml** is the file containing the BOM you want to verify*

The iascable build command will create a folder called output, if it doesn't already exist, then generate a folder within the output folder named using the **name** property in the metadata section of the BOM.  

Within this folder will be a file called **bom.yaml** which will be an expanded version of the original BOM (my_bom.yaml), pulling in all dependencies.  If a dependency cannot be automatically resolved you will get an error detailing which dependencies cannot be resolved.

## Variables

When a BOM is deployed there are some variables (values) that need to be provided to configure each module, so the desired state can be achieved.

When a module is created, a set of input variables are defined with the option of providing a default value for an input variable.

Some of the input variables may be generated by a dependent module.

The module.yaml file for a module defines the required input variables and if the variable comes from a dependent module.  It is also possible for a module to define optional input variables.

As the modules are Terraform modules, there are also the Terraform variable definitions (usually in veriables.tf and output.tf).  The Terraform files have the variable definitions along with any default values.

!!!Todo
    What is the relationship between the input/output variables defined in the module.yaml file and the Terraform input/output variables defined in the Terraform (.tf) files?

    -   is there any validation?
    -   are the modules.yaml file variables informational only?
    -   should the Terraform files be regarded as the source of truth?
